Create the the regression model for forecasts of futuristic levels 
All of us - add work on GitHub 
All of us - individual reflection
Also the research we got from websites can you link them in the references please

Also I was checking the mark scheme and I think there’s a few things we should add for the extra marks so:
- evaluate data quality
- any assumption we have made   about anything are listed
- ⁠analysis of key results
- ⁠results are explained in the context of the problem being addressed 
- ⁠suggest recommendations, all recommendations are clearly evidenced in the analysis 
- ⁠add references used for preliminary analysis

- omar elisa corey and tara to split word doc in 4 and review each quater for edits and misktakes.
